## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 2 - Unleash blockchain gameplay with Monad**

---

## 🎯 Objective

An engaging blockchain-powered game on **Monad** that delivers a fun and rewarding player experience.

By leveraging Monad’s smart contract capabilities, the game securely tracks in-game achievements on-chain. Players can **sync** their progress with their wallets, and the game offers a **high** replayability.

NEXORA demonstrates how blockchain, led by Monad, can elevate traditional gaming through trustless achievement systems and real-world incentives.

The game empowers both players and developers by combining fun platformer mechanics with real-world Web3 value.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Nexora`

### Team Members:  
- **Bandana Das** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bandana-web)] [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bandana-das-64b232291)] [UI Design & Asset Management]

### Your Approach:  
- **Why you chose this problem?**

*Out of all the given problem statements and tracks, we found this one the most interesting as it was realted to games. We sat in a conference call discussing the PS, and everyone agreed on this one in fraction of second!*

*Creating a game, without any prioir experience was challenging, but we were here to have fun! And fun, we did.*

- **Key challenges you addressed?**

*We challenged ourselves to create a game totally on vanilla JS. We had to use Node.js for hardhat and stuff, but no React or external libraries were used for the game. The most challenging part was tilemapping, which includes placing and mapping collision blocks throughout the map.*

*Even the game assets like coins, sound effects, and background music were made by us. 100% from scratch. And we just loved doing it.*

- **Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking?**

*Since the brainstorming phase, we planned on using two tracks, MONAD and Screenpipe. Monad would handle transactions and Screenpipe would record the screen when an achievement was done. But during development, Screenpipe was unfortunately removed by the organisers due to some technical development issues. We proceeded with the MONAD track and completed the game.*

## 🏁 Final Words

We had so much fun creating this project. Keeping everything else aside, like college studies, we really emjoyed diving deeper into Web3 and working so hard that this project becomes a reality. 12-13 hours of hard work, daily for 8 days straight, and finally worth it at the end. We are not here to win, we are here to learn and have fun. We won't complain though if winning comes to us as a by-product :)

And with more hackathons to come, NEXORA WILL GO FURTHER THAN THIS.

~Thank You.
